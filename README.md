# Sample-Machine-Learning-Projects
A sample of 5 Machine Learning projects I have completed out of my total 11.
SAMPLE MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT SUMMARIES

All projects were completed using structured data.
Project 1:
	The objective of this project was to determine which feature had the biggest impact on real estate price, and predict said variable price, in a specific neighborhood in New Zealand using Simple Multiple Regression. Regression equation is printed towards the end, along with table showing R-Squared value, along with testing and training accuracy.

Project 2:
	The objective of this project is to classify two different classes of seeds using measurements provided by the data set, using Perceptron, Adaline, and Adaline Stochastic Gradient Descent. Although there were three classes of seeds in the original data set, the third is removed for the sake of keeping it as binary classification. A small learning rate was used for Perceptron class compared two other two methods.

Project 3:
	Using the same seeds data set as project 2, multiple classification is performed on all three classes of seeds using Perceptron, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier, and K Nearest Neighbor.

Project 4:
	In this project a cardiogram data set is used where readings of a patient are taken, and I predict whether the patient would still be alive after a certain amount of time, after suffering a stroke or heart attack earlier in the patientâ€™s life. Sequential Feature Selection is used to select features that impact the target the most, reducing the total amount of features in the model, using less resources and time to complete the model using Logistic Regression.

Project 5:
	A data set using the nutritional information of randomly selected frozen pizzas is used in this project. Dimensionality reduction is achieved via PCA to reduce the data to two features, making a more efficient and faster model, while still retaining the quality of the model, with only two features capturing 90% of the variance in the data. Multiple Classification was used via Logistic Regression to classify the 10 different pizza brands. Asa a note, when studying the data further, different types of pizzas were used, such as Cauliflower crust, gluten free crust, meat lovers, and double extra cheese, while the remaining were more traditional types of pizza, hence the cluttering of several brands on top of each other. Most of the pizzas are linearly separable, even inside the cluster, but it would have been better to reclassify all the cluttered pizzas as the same brand/type, since nutritionally there was no difference, and having that many classes on top of each other impacted the accuracy of the model.
